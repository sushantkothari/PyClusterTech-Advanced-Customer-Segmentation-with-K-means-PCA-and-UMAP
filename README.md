# PyClusterTech: Advanced Customer Segmentation

PyClusterTech is an advanced customer segmentation tool that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster customer data. This project demonstrates the application of various clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and visualization methods to gain insights into customer behavior and characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations of feature distributions and relationships.
- **Multiple Clustering Algorithms**: Implements K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizes PCA and UMAP for better visualization of high-dimensional data.
- **Cluster Optimization**: Employs the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Includes 3D scatter plots, pair plots, and cluster maps for in-depth analysis.
- **Ensemble Clustering**: Combines results from multiple clustering algorithms for robust segmentation.
- **AutoML Integration**: Demonstrates the use of H2O AutoML for automated clustering.
- **Cluster Stability Analysis**: Assesses the stability of clustering results using bootstrap sampling.
- **Time-based Segmentation**: Implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for time-based customer segmentation.
- **Model Deployment**: Shows how to save and load the clustering model for future use.

## Importance

- **Business Strategy**: Helps businesses understand their customer base for targeted marketing and personalized services.
- **Customer Retention**: Identifies customer segments at risk of churn for proactive retention strategies.
- **Product Development**: Informs product development based on the needs of different customer segments.
- **Marketing Optimization**: Enables more effective allocation of marketing resources to different customer groups.
- **Academic Research**: Serves as a comprehensive example of advanced clustering techniques for data science students and researchers.
